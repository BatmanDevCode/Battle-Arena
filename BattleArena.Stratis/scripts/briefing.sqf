<br/>
First off... this game is a deathmatch. 
<br/>
Kill everyone and everything however you want with whatever is at your disposal. Have fun and dont take it to seriously.
<br/>

<br/>
Alot of people seems to not know this, but to lock on to a target on this server you need to have the target in your sights then press T
<br/>

<br/>
If your new at this mission then keep your head down!
<br/>
all arma weapons and gear is available here, alot of players use thermal vision to hunt you.
<br/>
check if your vehicle or scope have thermals by pressing N key.
<br/>

<br/>
when youre in a jet, you can hold ctrl and press right mouse button then N to bring up a thermal camera.
<br/>
thanks to E6YH UCYCA B POT for showing me this one, i had no idea.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Atomic- Bomb:
<br/>
on the south end of the airstrip a Bomber will respawn every 7 minutes if
<br/>
destroyed. NOTE:sometimes when the bomb is dropped at an area that has alot
of elevation, then sometimes it wont go off, or have a delayed detonation... but if you drop it on level ground around the airfield, then it should go off every time.
<br/>

<br/>
Weapons Loadout:
<br/>
in your scroll menu you have acces to whatever weapons you want via
<br/>
Virtual Ammobox and Virtual Arsenal.
<br/>
both of these lets you send loadouts to other players.
<br/>
so if youre new, then ask someone to send you a good loadout.
<br/>
I suggest you save atleast an anti tank and anti air loadout.
<br/>
some anti thermal clothing is not a bad idea either, 
<br/>
you dont want to light up on someones thermal Camera.
<br/>

<br/>
Skydiving:
<br/>
a scroll option to skydive has been added to every respawn, if you use vehicle or weapons menu it will disapear.
<br/>
Backspace now cuts you away from youre parachute, it also adds a new parachute. can also be used on ground to equip a parachute on your back. 
<br/>
dont cutaway below 100 meters!
<br/>

<br/>
Static Weapons:
<br/>
use scroll menu to spawn static eweapon, changes have been made to some static veapons. press F to reload with the new ammo.
<br/>

<br/>
Groups:
<br/>
players can now team up, using the ATLAS squad menu, press U key to accsess it.
<br/>
there is also a player scroll action for it, but this may disapear after a while.
<br/>
when your in a squad, you will see the location of your team members. 
<br/>
teaming up using tanks and choppers is good fun.
<br/>

<br/>
Vehicles:
<br/>
Use your scroll menu to spawn random vehicles, some of these may have altered weapons.
<br/>
there is also depots around the map that will spawn a spesific vehicle for you,
<br/>
these will not have altered weapons.
<br/>

<br/>
UAV: 
<br/>
everyone is a uav operator.
<br/>
there is a couple uav`s that respawns on the map with altered weapons, open your uav menu to connect to these.
<br/>
or you could spawn your own little armed parrot drone with your weapons menu and conect to it. (scroll to manual fire and use fire selector to arm).
<br/>
there is also the Autonomous Depot that will let you spawn whatever drone you want, these will not have altered weapons.
<br/>


<br/>
Guided Bombs:
<br/>
If you get a plane randomly from the vehicle scroll menu then it will have the option to turn guided bombs on or off via the planes scroll menu.
<br/>
now you can manually guide your bombs to the target. your plane shouldnt crash when your guiding your bomb, 
<br/>
but esc button takes you back to the plane.
<br/>
note that this only works on the GBU12, 2 round magazine bombs.
<br/>

<br/>
Napalm Airstrike:
<br/>
There is a red map marker that reads Call Napalm Airstrike, search this area and you will find a phonebooth  to call airstrike from.
<br/>
It will make you place two markers on the map,  the first is where the drop starts and the second is the direction of the drop.
<br/>
When an airstrike has been called there will be a 4 minute cool down period
